# #MamaNyoSquad (Preview)

_**Enter the universe through the eyes of the Tengu! ðŸ’•**_

This repository contains all of the preview frameworks that might be implemented into upstream (`MamaNyoSquad/mamanyosquad.github.io`)! This is to ensure that the website follows a new "unified" design language that works well with all devices!

# Overview

This repository contains a collection of bleeding-edge website iterations which may be applied to our upstream repository [`mamanyosquad.github.io`](https://github.com/MamaNyoSquad/mamanyosquad.github.io), in accordance to the SquadMates' initiative to provide a new "unified" experience across the website.

The SquadMates -- both the [G.Mgr](https://github.com/thebelovedmoon) and the [SocWeb Mgr](https://github.com/Ortega082) -- and fellow collaborators can share ideas on how to improve the website, and provide ways to make it livelier.

Note that some web features -- like #MamaNyoSquad Publishing -- are excluded from this collaborative effort as this is under the G.Mgr's discretion.
