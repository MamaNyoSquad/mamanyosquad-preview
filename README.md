# About Replicating this Branch

This branch is intended to be empty, but here are a few points to take note:

- `.devcontainer` should **NOT** be empty as to preview your web instance via either `localhost` or its provided URL. It contains files critical to creating a GitHub Codespace and is pre-prepared with commands to keep your Codespace terminal up-to-date.
  - Learn more about GitHub Codespaces [here](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview).
- To start working on your iteration, replicate this branch (and delete this README if you want to) -- then provision the Codespace. Details can be found in `CONTRIBUTING.md` of the `info` branch.
  - **IMPORTANT:** `index.html` and `404.html` is automatically provided on this branch for convenience.
